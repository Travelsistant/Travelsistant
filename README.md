# Final Project - PawnConnect

PawnConnect is a mobile application to make Pawn activity easier. It helps pawn shop and the person who want to pawn their stuff find each others.
User can post things they want to pawn including description and pictures to the system. The pawn shop can see it, and they can offer the price, the interest rate, and also the period for that stuff and join somehow called a bid with other shops. User can see the offers from the shops and choose the one they like the most.
Pawn shops can also offer to buy the things from the user.
